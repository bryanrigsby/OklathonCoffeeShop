# Accounts needed

- Plan
    - Send out FreeCodeCamp material to make sure everyone has basic HTML/CSS and hopefully JS knowledge
    - Make sure everyone has software and accounts
    - Go over the whole process
    - Divide up issues (have this planned before hand - have in front of seats prior to class starting?)
    - Have everyone fork repo
    - Work on issue
    - When issue ready, create pull request
    - Review pull requests (give more tasks if time allows)
    - When all pull requests in and approved, merge all code and display final product
    - Think about what to do if time left after merge.  (Maybe students can come up with ideas to make it better)
